# Shtdwn-WinUpdate

Hi there!
This script is used to disable or manage Windows Updates.
We all know windows has quite a reputation for forcing updates onto us.

Be aware that I haven't tested this script fully so you're at your own risk, I will not be held responsable for any damage that happens to your PC.

## Use

There is a .bat and .exe file<br />

They're both the same thing, just included the batch script file if you want to make modifications or just to read the source code if you're suspicious about files containing malware.

### IMPORTANT!

_Make sure you run any of the files in administrator mode or else some functions might now work!_
