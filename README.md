# Shtdwn-WinUpdate

Hi there!
This script is used to disable or manage Windows Updates.
We all know windows has quite a reputation for forcing updates onto us.

Script has been tested in Windows11 Insider [Beta -- 24H2: build 26080.1] .

## Use

There is a .bat and .exe file<br />

They're both the same thing, just included the batch script file if you want to make modifications or just to read the source code if you're suspicious about files containing malware.

### IMPORTANT!

_Make sure you run any of the files in administrator mode or else some functions might now work!_
